Readcast Grades Definitions

## Intern (fresh out of school)
Iterns have basically only theoretical knowledge and no work experience. In this case, a beginner’s job title will be a Intern.
#### Technical skillset and duties
 - No work experience
 - Teoretical knowledge of programming
 - little to no exposure to real development
 - are primarily limited to using IDEs as text editors for coding without leveraging their additional features
 - rarely deal with APIs
 - often have to consult the documentation
 - are not familiar with any frameworks
 - have only a vague idea of what a database is
#### Experience
 - 0 - 6 Months
#### Will face one of this Test Task
 - TestTask 1
 - TestTask 2
 - TestTask 3

#### Vision
Trainee need very close supervision. Often the supervisor of a trainee is called a baby sitter.

## Junior Developer
Being impatient, they want immediate results. At the same time, mistakes can paralyze them, since they do not know how to handle them.
The main issue is that they overlook the larger context, perhaps considering it irrelevant.

#### Technical skillset and duties
 - Navigate the interface and operate IDEs efficiently using the taskbar.
 - know how to handle the most frequently used APIs
 - have worked with some frameworks
 - knows DB basic design techniques
 - ACID properties, and transactions
 - can write simple, select statements to retrieve information from the database
 - familiar with one programming language
 - professional experience with about three platforms
 - aware of alternatives to popular and standard tools
 - get the least complex tasks, those with little impact on the final product
 - need close supervision
 - need strong mentoring to grow their skills
 - Motivated and energetic
#### Experience
 - 1- 3 Years
#### Will face one of this Test Task
 - TestTask 1
 - TestTask 2
 - TestTask 3
#### Vision
Juniors need close supervision. They need strong mentoring to grow their skills, because the main problem with juniors is that they are code-focused, rather than development-focused. This prevents them from getting the big picture.

## Middle Developer
Middle devs with generally more than three years of experience can leverage their skills out to become mid-level specialists. Mid-level devs,  sometimes referred to as “the workhorses of the programming world,” deliver the most impact with routine code.
#### Technical skillset and duties
 - referred to as “the workhorses of the programming world,” deliver the most impact with routine code
 - they can do a decent job of troubleshooting and debugging
 - highly initiative and resourceful
 - pursue leadership roles on the team and can mentor novices
 - still lack the experience to prioritize the focus of their attention while working on the project
 - they are barely able to reflect on their mistakes
 - using IDEs for quite a while, a middle dev has memorized the shortcut keys for most frequent operations, really speeding up the work
 - have deep and solid knowledge of the main APIs
 - are tech-savvy with frameworks which helps them write clearer and shorter code
 - are good at managing databases
 - can design normalized DB schemas while taking into account the queries that will be issued
 - are adept in the object-relational mapping technique (ORM)
 - they apply knowledge of index syntax to create custom clustered and non-clustered indexes
 - understands functional programming and knows when and how to apply functional concepts in any language
 - have already worked with more than four platforms
 - possess a deep understanding of how the platform functions including code execution
 - very comfortable with their package manager tools
 - are not commonly entrusted with highly complicated tasks that may require an in-depth level of engineering knowledge
 - they may be tasked with designing a piece of the application to be prepared for the further transition to a senior developer
 - apable of turning tickets into solutions
 - providing estimates on tasks
 - assisting in decomposing larger sections of work
 - can deliver work with less supervision while being assigned to relatively routine tasks
 - actively collaborate with team members, including designers, business analysts, and architects
 - have deepened their understanding of development cycle scenarios which allows them to practice Agile methods more accurately
 - see the results of the occurring problems and learn how to avoid them in the future
 - A lot of mid-level devs fall under the Dunning-Kruger effect, which hampers their further career growth
 - may tend to overestimate their skills, which impedes their progress
#### Experience
 - 3 - 5 Years
#### Will face one of this Test Task
 - TestTask 1
 - TestTask 2
 - TestTask 3
#### Vision
A lot of mid-level devs fall under the Dunning-Kruger effect, which hampers their further career growth.  This psychological phenomenon describes what a dangerous thing a little knowledge can actually be. Being self-assured, developers may tend to overestimate their skills, which impedes their progress. That said, this condition is a big concern in software development. While this cognitive bias can happen to workers on every seniority level, mids are most vulnerable to it.
## Senior Developer
Developers with deep specialized knowledge and exhaustive experience that allow them to mentor their peers are titled Seniors. In addition, senior devs are also knowledgeable in the business domain they support. Their competency may even expand to help with marketing and overall business development. A senior developer will always think of what they are doing in terms of how much benefit it brings to the business.
#### Technical skillset and duties
 - deep specialized knowledge and exhaustive experience
 - mentor their peers
 - knowledgeable in the business domain they support
 - Their competency may even expand to help with marketing and overall business development
 - always think of what they are doing in terms of how much benefit it brings to the business
 - their job is to provide the best solutions to problems
 - a senior is trying to foresee the issue and resolve it before it happens
 - senior must think in advance about the system bottlenecks
 - keep in mind vulnerabilities and problems caused by the improper use of tools
 - leading a project
 - senior makes well-reasoned decisions about software design and implementation based on the knowledge of the best practices in the field
 - they are able to reflect on their work performance, analyze mistakes, and learn from them drawing the right conclusions
 - senior developers have transformed their expertise into intuition
 - intuit best practices from their broad range of experience with different roles, technologies, and situations
 - understands the business value behind the product
 - comfortable with multiple technologies
 - aiming at acquiring transferable knowledge that will allow them to recognize and write good code in any programming language
 - A seniors’ expertise allows them to write custom macros to optimize the workflow
 - A senior has written libraries to add more functionality or to automate the most frequent processes without having to write code for them
 - have enough knowledge to build their own custom framework
 - well-versed in database administration, performance, and index optimization
 - they do the delicate work of composing advanced select queries
 - they are familiar with the DB maintenance features, in particular, DB mirroring and DB replication
 - can replace slow cursor-based operations with much more efficient JOIN statements
 - Besides functional programming and OOP, they work with concurrent and logic languages
 - have had professional experience with more than 6 platforms
 - creating debuggers or other tools necessary to enhance the platform
 - brainstorm the right technological solutions to complex problems
 - take charge of the team, coordinating its workflow to consistently produce business value

#### Experience
 - 5+ Years
#### Will face one of this Test Task
 - TestTask 1
 - TestTask 2
 - TestTask 3
#### Vision
Seniors see the final goal — the problems that the finished application must solve. A long-term vision is a crucial point in bringing value to the end-user.
